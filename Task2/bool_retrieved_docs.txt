serum
from
patients
with
cystic

and
control
subjects
without
cystic

was
analyzed
for
carboxypeptidase
b
like
activity
in
the
presence
of
optimal
concentrations
of
co
ion
hippuryl
l
lysine
and
serum
fourteen
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
patients
had
no
steatorrhea
and
therefore
minimal
pancreatic
dysfunction
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
controls
were
of
comparable
age
serum
carboxypeptidase
b
like
activity
was
significantly
decreased
in
cystic

patients
including
cystic

patients
without
steatorrhea
significantly
low
values
were
found
in
both
male
and
female
cystic

patients
when
compared
with
controls
of
similar
sex
although
values
were
unaffected
by
age
in
the
control
population
values
in
older
patients
with
cystic

were
significantly
lower
than
values
in
younger
patients
no
correlation
was
obtained
between
serum
carboxypeptidase
b
like
activity
and
pulmonary
or
hepatic
function
serum
carboxypeptidase
b
like
activity
therefore
falls
with
progression
of
the
disease
and
may
limit
the
ability
to
degrade
circulating
peptides
in
older
patients
with

deficient
serum
carboxypeptidase
b

is
less

activity
against

was
studied
in

from

the
