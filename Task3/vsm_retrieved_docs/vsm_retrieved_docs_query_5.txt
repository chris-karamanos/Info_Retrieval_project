cystic
fibrosis
clinical
aspects
cystic
fibrosis
is
a
fatal
inherited
disease
involving
many
different
organs
at
one
time
most
affected
children
died
within
a
few
years
of
birth
but
modern
management
has
led
to
a
marked
improvement
in
prognosis
and
of
course
to
an
increase
in
the
number
of
affected
older
children
and
young
adults
cystic
fibrosis
is
therefore
no
longer
a
disease
encountered
only
in
paediatric
units
but
with
increasing
survival
into
teens
and
twenties
affected
patients
are
now
appearing
in
adult
units
the
aetiology
and
pathology
the
clinical
picture
diagnosis
treatment
and
prognosis
are
discussed

relationship
between
hepatic
and
pancreatic
disease
a
voluminous
literature
has
dealt
with
the
variety
of
pathologic
entities
that
may
effect
the
liver
and
the
pancreas
much
of
it
includes
poorly
or
vaguely
documented
observations
only
a
few
facets
have
been
subjected
to
experimental
study
despite
the
resultant
difficulty
in
unraveling
reported
and
inferred
relationships
between
the
two
organs
the
available
information
has
been
analyzed
according
to
the
following
arbitrary
categorization
involvement
of
the
liver
in
pancreatic
disease
involvement
of
the
pancreas
in
hepatic
disease
involvement
of
both
organs
in
systemic
disease

effects
of
calcium
on
intestinal
mucin
implications
for
cystic
fibrosis
a
major
feature
of
the
disease
cystic
fibrosis
is
the
excessive
concentration
of
mucus
within
ducts
and
glands
of
mucous
producing
organs
some
mucous
secretions
also
show
an
elevation
in
calcium
concentration
using
purified
rat
intestinal
goblet
cell
mucin
as
a
model
mucin
we
have
investigated
the
effect
of
millimolar
additions
mm
of
cacl
on
the
physical
properties
of
the
mucin
isotonicity
of
incubation
media
was
preserved
in
order
to
mimic
in
vivo
conditions
cacl
mm
caused
a
decrease
in
viscosity
no
change
in
electrophoretic
mobility
in
acrylamide
gels
and
a
decrease
in
solubility
of
the
mucin
solubility
changes
were
reversed
by
the
addition
of
edta
mm
to
incubations
insolubility
was
also
produced
in
incubations
of
mucin
with
a
mixture
of
soluble
intestinal
contents
nacl
washings
these
findings
strongly
suggest
that
the
mucin
became
smaller
and
more
dense
as
calcium
was
added
a
process
most
probably
achieved
by
loss
of
intramolecular
water

suggests
that
the
primary

in
this
disease
is
manifested
partly
as
a
defect
in
glycoprotein
metabolism
this
defect
may
result
from
an
abnormality
in

more

epidemiology
of
cystic
fibrosis
a
review
three
main
reasons
have
been
advanced
for
the
degree
of
ignorance
and
confusion
surrounding
epidemiologic
measures
of
the
incidence
and
prevalence
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
relatively
recent
recognition
of
cf
as
a
specific
disease
entity
wide
range
of
clinical
manifestations
presentation
as
a
multisystem
disease
and
great
natural
variation
in
the
severity
of
involvement
of
various
organs
past
difficulty
in
establishing
a
diagnosis
based
on
sound
laboratory
evidence
this
being
largely
due
to
the
lack
of
a
screening
test
that
had
gained
wide
acceptance
among
diagnosticians
and
inaccuracies
in
the
performance
and
interpretation
of
the
sweat
test
in
addition
to
these
factors
there
are
a
number
of
methodological
deficiencies
and
questionable
assumptions
in
several
of
the
papers
that
have
here
been
reviewed
it
may
be
noteworthy
that
the
two
sets
of
authors
whose
research
design
most
closely
matched
being
aimed
at
providing
multiple
ascertainment
of
cases
and
cross
checks
of
validity
have
arrived
at
nearly
the
same
estimated
incidence
of
this
particular
disorder
and
respectively
the
issue
of
selection
and
diagnostic
criteria
is
one
that
has
important
implications
for
epidemiologic
studies
of
cystic
fibrosis
particularly
in
a
disease
like
cf
where
the
spectrum
of
clinical
manifestations
and
severity
of
involvement
is
so
broad
estimates
of
incidence
will
vary
according
to
the
criteria
by
which
cases
are
ascertained
and
included
a
greater
degree
of
uniformity
in
standards
than
has
been
employed
in
previous
studies
is
necessary
before
comparisons
can
meaningfully
be
made
there
are
good
grounds
for
regarding
most
estimates
of
cf
incidence
to
be
minimum
confirmed
figures
and
this
is
particularly
so
where
the
research
design
ensures
that
multiple
ascertainments
of
the
same
case
will
be
identifiable
higher
estimates
are
made
where
several
sources
of
error
respondent
bias
generalization
of
hospital
data
to
the
wider
population
multiple
ascertainments
of
the
same
patient
are
not
recognised
