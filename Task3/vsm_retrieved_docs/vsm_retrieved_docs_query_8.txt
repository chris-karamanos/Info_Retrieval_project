amantadine
hc
an

clinically
effective
against

of

a

was
evaluated
in

double
blind
trial
in
children
with

during
the
initial
appearance
of
influenza
a
england
virus
in
the
new
england
area
infection
with
this
variant
strain
of
influenza
virus
did
not
reach
epidemic
proportions
during
the
study
so
that
the
effectiveness
of
amantadine
in
this
study
population
could
not
be
fully
assessed
however
the
potential
symptomatic
and
biochemical
toxicity
of
amantadine
was
carefully
monitored
in
a
pediatric
population
serologic
screening
by
complement
fixation
tests
indicated
that
respiratory
viruses
may
be
important
pathogens
in
exacerbations
of

in
patients

pulmonary
diseases
in
children
respiratory
infections
in
infants
and
children
cause
much
ill
health
and
also
an
appreciable
mortality
they
are
found
at
times
in
most
school
children
and
in
infants
especially
those
in
large
families
and
those
living
in
poor
circumstances
in
all
respiratory
infections
the
whole
respiratory
tract
is
involved
for
descriptive
purposes
it
is
useful
to
divide
these
infections
into
upper
respiratory
tract
infections
in
which
the
infection
is
predominantly
at
the
larynx
or
above
and
lower
respiratory
tract
infections
in
which
the
predominant
infection
is
below
the
larynx
acute
upper
respiratory
tract
infections
are
usually
viral
and
the
poly
virus
infection
of
coryza
is
the
commonest
acute
lower
respiratory
tract
infections
are
discussed
in
two
groups
in
infants
under
two
years
of
age
and
in

over

immunologic
aspects
of
cystic
fibrosis
pp
because
of
the
prominent
role
of
infection
in
cystic
fibrosis
and
because
of
the
genetic
nature
of
both
cystic
fibrosis
and
specific
immune
defects
considerable
effort
has
been
expended
in
determining
if
there
are
hereditary
immune
defects
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
that
render
them
susceptible
to
infection
against
a
congenital
immune
defect
is
the
fact
that
the
infections
nearly
always
are
localized
to
the
lung
with
the
same
two
organisms
rather
than
infections
at
multiple
sites
involving
multiple
organisms
specific
immune
mechanisms
in
the
b
and

cell
systems
are
examined
nonspecific
host
defense
mechanisms
include
the
complement
system
phagocytosis
pulmonary
clearance
the
pulmonary
barrier
to
the

of
