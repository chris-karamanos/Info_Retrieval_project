effects
of
malnutrition
on
the
maturing
central
nervous
system
during
recent
years
more
and
more
data
have
been
accumulated
implicating
early
malnutrition
in
subsequent
small
stature
and
behavioral
abnormalities
these
studies
can
be
divided
into
two
large
categories
one
dealing
with
cellular
and
biochemical
changes
at
a
tissue
level
and
one
dealing
with
functional
changes
within
the
nervous
system
as
measured
by
changes
in
various
modes
of
behavior
this
chapter
will
attempt
to
review
the
studies
in
both
of
these
broad
categories
which
have
led
to
the
present
concept
that
malnutrition
during
the
growing
period
will
permanently
retard
growth
resulting
in
a
stunted
individual
and
markedly
retard
psychologic
development
resulting
in
an
individual
with
permanently
altered
behaviors
we
shall
first
consider
the
normal
cellular
and
biochemical
development
of
the
central
nervous
system
second
we
shall
examine
how
malnutrition
alters
these
cellular
and
biochemical
processes
and
finally
we
shall
review
the
evidence
that
implicates
early
malnutrition
with
alterations
in
later
behavior
and
ability
to
learn

prenatal
detection
of
genetic
defects
the
intrauterine
detection
of
genetic
disorders
represents
one
of
the
exciting
advances
in
medicine
the
major
emphasis
in
this
chapter
will
be
a
detailed
review
of
the
newer
approaches
toward
antenatal
detection
of
congenital
malformations
and
hemoglobinopathies
as
well
as
an
overview
of
the
experience
and
problems
of
antenatal
detection
for
chromosomal
aberrations
and
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
approaches
to
prenatal
diagnosis
of
genetic
disorders
include
amniocentesis
visualization
of
the
fetus
and
fetal
blood
sampling
prenatal
detection
of
genetic
disorders
has
become
a
reality
the
area
is
evolving
so
rapidly
that
the
major
indications
for
intrauterine
diagnosis
have
substantially
changed
within
the
past
year
prior
to
this
time
maternal
age
previous
down
s
syndrome
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
and
x
linked
recessive
disorders
were
the
primary
criteria
with
approximately
of
the
cases
being
used
for
cytogenetic
analysis
within
the
past
year
in
a
number
of
laboratories
about
half
of
the
referrals
for
amniocentesis
have
been
for
central
nervous
system
defects
certainly
with
the
development
of
technics
for
fetal
blood
sampling
this
distribution
of
the
frequencies
of
indication
may
once
again
change
substantially
most
probably
for
the
next
few
years
cytogenetic
abnormalities
and
neural
tube
defects
will
be
the
most
common
indications
for
amniocentesis
amniocentesis
will
continue
to
be
offered
to
many
patients
with
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
and
probably
will
be
available
for
monitoring
of
hemoglobinopathies
and
other
disorders
of
fetal
blood
as
well
as
for
accurate
knowledge
of
the
health
of
the
fetus

bronchial
mucus
secretion
in
cystic
fibrosis
mucus
is
the
primary
aetiological
factor
in
the
development
of
pulmonary
disease
in
cystic
fibrosis
biochemical
studies
on
bronchial
secretions
have
not
yet
confirmed
any
qualitative
difference
in
composition
or
in
the
nature
of
the
glycoproteins
the
major
component
of
secretion
with
the
lack
of
any
clear
evidence
of
a
basic
abnormality
in
the
nature
of
mucus
attention
has
been
directed
to
the
possible
defect
in
the
control
of
mucus
secretion
this
encompasses
alteration
in
the
normal
regulation
of
the
autonomic
nervous
system
or
to
its
stimulation
either
at
the
cellular
or
intracellular
control
level
in
recent
years
attention
has
focused
on
the
presence
of
ciliotoxic
factors
in

of

with

and
their
possible
role
in
the
pathophysiology
of

the

recent
research
in
cystic
fibrosis
this
review
emphasizes
some
of
the
positive
accomplishments
of
cystic
fibrosis
research
some
of
the
puzzles
and
some
of
the
recent
developments
that
have
promise
one
of
the
major
unresolved
questions
is
the
maintenance
of
this
lethal
gene
at
such
a
high
frequency
perhaps
because
of
a
heterozygote
advantage
in
the
past
no
longer
operative
at
present
nothing
is
known
of
the
chromosomal
localization
of
the
trait
except
that
chromosomes
are
morphologically
normal
that
it
is
autosomal
not
sex
linked
and
that
there
is
no
correlation
with
blood
groups
or
major
hla
loci
one
of
the
important
achievements
of
the
past
many
years
is
that
we
understand
relatively
well
the
pathogenesis
of
most
clinical
manifestations
of
cf
the
as
yet
unknown
inherited
basic
defect
or
metabolic
error
of
cf
gives
rise
to
two
main
anomalies
the
electrolyte
defect
in
exocrine
sweat
glands
and
the
mucous
secretion
abnormality
while
the
results
of
tissue
culture
studies
often
have
been
conflicting
and
disparate
it
does
seem
to
be
the
consensus
that
the
fibroblasts
are
affected
by
the
basic
metabolic
error
in
some
manner
and
that
they
respond
abnormally
under
different
experimental
circumstances
virtually
all
investigators
have
found
some
anomalies
in
biologic
fluids
of
cf
although
using
different
approaches
and
methods
an
abnormality
in
the
function
of
the
autonomic
nervous
system
which
is
so
closely
associated
with
the
exocrine
glands
has
always
been
an
attractive
explanation
for
the
generalized
exocrinopathy
of
cf
the
search
for
a
genetic
animal
model
for
cf
has
led
to
interesting
findings
