cystic
fibrosis
fibrocystic
disease
of
the
pancreas
is
a
common
inherited
disease
which
to
date
still
has
a
fatal
outcome
the
diversity
of
clinical
manifestations
and
pathological
findings
has
added
further
to
the
mysterious
nature
of
the
disease
as
have
the
tantalizingly
conflicting
results
of
biochemical
physical
and
experimental
studies
in
many
laboratories
of
the
western
world
one
of
the
most
constant
clinical
observations
is
the
viscosity
of
the
secretion
of
the
mucosal
glands
in
the
respiratory
and
alimentary
tracts
in
the
ducts
of
the
biliary
system
and
in
the
pancreas
in
approximately
to
per
cent
of
all
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
the
earliest
manifestation
meconium
ileus
occurs
in
the
neonatal
period
in
the
remaining
to
per
cent
of
affected
infants
the
symptoms
generally
become
evident
within
the
course
of
the
first
year
of
life
the
lung
symptoms
tend
to
dominate
the
clinical
picture
in
the
vast
majority
of
untreated
patients
and
will
ultimately
decide
the
outcome
the
lower
respiratory
tract
is
not
the
only
part
involved
nasal
polyps
and
the
accumulation
of
viscous
secretions
in
the
paranasal
sinuses
with
subsequent
bacterial
infection
are
not
unusual
pancreatic
deficiency
is
present
in
the
vast
majority
of
patients
with
cystic

and
consists
of
a
gross
reduction
or
complete
absence
of

some

management

the
treatment
of
pulmonary

the

important
aspect
of
care
in
patients
with
cystic

its
prevention
is
priority
number
one
in
the
over

the
outlook
for
the
child

depends
to
a
large
extent
upon
the
avoidance

cf
we
are
puzzled
by
certain
unusual

in
the
two
cases
presented
we
agree
that
it
would
be
important
to
recognize
the
occurrence
of
adh

hyponatremia
in
cf
we
would
though
appreciate
the

on
the
weight
losses
and
the
fluid

electrolyte

also
helpful
would
be
information
on
furosemide
dosage
and
any
other
drugs
such
as
acetaminophen
which
may
have
been
given
so
we
can
further
understand
the
pathophysiology
of
these
two
complex
patients
we
do
not
think
there
was
hypovolemia
in

after

both

were
receiving
antibiotics
and

was
receiving
digitalis
as
well
the
reason
for
production
of
adh
remains
obscure
as
it
is
in
most
cases
of
siadh
although
it
was
mentioned
in
the
discussion
that
the
transient
nature
of

in

would
argue
against

the
classic
stereotype
of
the

an
infant
with
a
chronic

and

improved
medical
care
is
enabling
many
of
these
patients
to
reach
adulthood
and
increased
diagnostic
suspicion
is
resulting
in
identification
of
the
disease
in
more
adults
based
upon
analysis
of
over
cases
of
cf
reported
during
the
year
by
cystic
fibrosis
centers
the
national
cystic
fibrosis
foundation
estimated
that
the
probability
of
an
individual
with
cf
surviving
to
age
was
approximately
although
most
of
these
adults
are
currently
under
the
care
of
pediatricians
the
development
of
medical
psychiatric
surgical
or
obstetric
complications
may
necessitate
the
involvement
of
other
professionals
a
joint
study
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
adults
conducted
by
duke
medical
center
and
the
nih
has
shown
that
the
majority
of
affected
adults
including
those
diagnosed
early
in

are
married
and
work
full
or
part
time
many
manifest
few
if
any
symptoms
until
relatively
late
in
life
since
this
study
was
retrospective
the
reported
frequencies
of
the
clinical
findings
tend
to
underestimate
in
all
instances
the
actual
incidence
in
the
population
studied
the
reported
incidence
of
cf
in
the
united

has
been
conservatively
estimated
at
live

if
all

the
