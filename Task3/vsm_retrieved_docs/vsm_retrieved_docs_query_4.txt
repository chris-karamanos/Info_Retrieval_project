the
patterns
of
infection
in
cystic
fibrosis
thirty
five
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
aged
months
to
years
have
been
investigated
with
regard
to
respiratory
symptoms
respiratory
tract
pathogens
serum
immunoglobulins
and
serum
precipitins
haemophilus
influenzae
was
the
commonest
pathogen
being
supplanted
in
advanced
disease
by
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
the
patients
who
had
no
respiratory
infection
had
levels
of
igg
significantly
lower
than
normal
children
of
comparable
ages
in
children
with
severe
respiratory
infection
the
immunoglobulins
were
raised
and
precipitins
to
the
predominant
respiratory
organism
were
present
these
findings
differ
from
the
prevalent
view
that
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
have
a
normal
response
to
infection
and
that
the
common
infecting
organism
is
staphylococcus
aureus

the

pattern
for
the
bacteriology
of

staphylococcus

is
the

to
the
results
accord
with
the
original
hypothesis
of

and
may
in
of
patients
the
sputum
bacterial
flora
changed
as
the
hypothesis
of
burns
and
may
predicted
this
preliminary
data
suggests
that
one
of
the
primary
sputum
abnormalities
in
cystic

may
be
increased

which
makes
the
sputum
susceptible
to
colonisation
by
s
aureus
after
infection
the
ca
concentration
is
reduced
and
the
lung
becomes
susceptible
to
colonisation
by
other
microorganisms
including
h
influenzae
p
aeruginosa
and
escherichia
coli

titres
of
precipitins
against

by
means
of

the

fewer

on

there
was
no

between
the

most

the
antibodies
were

notably
those
of

s

precipitins
were
generally
found
in
higher
numbers
in

in

but
on
an
average
the
titre
of
the
precipitins
in

was
higher
than

three
of
the
precipitins
were
detectable
only
in

one
of
these
