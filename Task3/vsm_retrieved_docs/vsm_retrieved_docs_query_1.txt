cystic
fibrosis
comparison
of
two
mucolytic
drugs
for
inhalation
treatment
acetylcysteine
and
arginine
hydrochloride
clinical
bronchoscopic
spirographic
scintigraphic
and
chemical
analyses
were
done
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
assess
the
mucolytic
effects
of
acetylcysteine
inhalations
versus
l
arginine
hydrochloride
aerosols
the
latter
drug
is
less
active
than
acetylcysteine
and
should
not
be
used
to
treat
children
with
cystic
fibrosis

bronchial
drainage
with
aerosol
medications
in
cystic
fibrosis
examined
in
this
study
are
the
immediate
effects
of
bronchial
drainage
preceded
by
the
inhalation
of
aerosol
solutions
of
a
mucolytic
agent
a
bronchodilator
and
their
combination
upon
four
measures
of
pulmonary
function
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
on
three
separate
occasions
pulmonary
function
was
tested
preceding
and
following
treatments
consisting
of
one
of
the
above
three
aerosol
solutions
followed
by
bronchial
drainage
the
order
of
solutions
used
was
random
and
each
subject
received
one
treatment
with
each
solution
the
greatest
overall
improvement
in
function
was
seen
with
the
bronchodilator
and
bronchial
drainage
the
combination
of
the
bronchodilator
mucolytic
agents
and
bronchial
drainage
was
the
next
most
effective
technique
the
mucolytic
agent
when
used
alone
with
bronchial
drainage
decreased
function
comparison
of
the
pulmonary
function
scores
indicated
a
significant
difference
among
the
three
treatments

treatment
of
mucus
hypersecretion
in
human
disease
treatment
of
mucus
hypersecretion
in
human
disease
should
first
be
directed
at
prevention
the
hypersecretion
of
mucus
even
in
the
absence
of
pus
in
the
sputum
or
of
other
signs
of
infection
is
of
itself
associated
with
significantly
poor
lung
function
infection
is
probably
the
important
stimulus
in
cystic
fibrosis
certain
anti
inflammatory
agents
are
now
known
to
cause
retention
of
mucus
within
the
secretory
cells
although
the
rate
of
synthesis
is
not
raised
it
may
be
that
this
offers
a
new
way
of
control
on
the
other
hand
the
cells
become
larger
and
this
may
be
undesirable
i
would
prefer
to
see
a
study
of
the
effect
of
drugs
on
the
cellular
stages
of
synthesis
and
discharge
rather
than
concentration
on
mucolytic
agents

management
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
reports
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
living
well
whilst
on
intensive
treatment
can
be
covered
by
allegations
that
their
disease
must
be
basically
mild
more
revealing
evidence
comes
from
the
longterm
survival
studies
done
by
professor
warren
warwick
of
the
university
of
minnesota
the
introduction
of
antibiotics
have
allowed
the
children
to
live
loner
but
were
dead
by
aged
years
physiotherapy
given
after
infections
prolonged
lives
so
that
half
were
still
alive
at
years
but
still
faced
a
relentless
death
rate
prophylactic
daily
physiotherapy
produced
a
doubling
of
survival
at
years
from
under
to
over
i
do
not
deny
for
a
moment
that
daily
physiotherapy
with
inhalations
is
a
great
strain
on
the
family
but
it
is
not
as
great
as
the
strain
of
watching
the
slow
and
relentless
decline
of
the
child
which
with
racking
cough
and
persistent
dyspnoea
is
anything
but
peaceful

questions
regarding
arginine
hydrochloride
inhalation
with
regard
to
the
recent
study
of
dietzsch
et
al
on
the
use
of
arginine
hydrochloride
inhalation
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
i
wish
to
point
out
that
these
investigators
acted
irresponsibly
in
exposing
their
patients
for
an
appreciable
period
seven
weeks
to
a
preparation
which
is
known
to
be
irritating
i
would
suggest
that
the
deleterious
effects
seen
by
dietzsch
et
al
are
due
to
their
inattention
to
experimental
detail
and
lack
of
communication
with
other
investigators
dietzsch
et
al
give
the
impression
in
their
article
that
all
arginine
solution
are
detrimental
to
the
lung
we
wish
to
point
out
that
l
arginine
hydrochloride
buffered
with
a
sodium
solution
is
irritative
to
the
airway
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
however
no
comparison
studies
were
done
with
l
arginine
buffered
with
free
base
the
fate
of
these
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
depends
on
the
quality
of
the
inhalation
treatment
this
means
if
you
replace
a
good
mucolytic
drug
with
a
better
one
you
step
by
step
approach
the
ideal
mucolytic
solution
we
think
it
to
be
unethical
to
use
other
less
effective
drugs
or
solutions
in
a
control
group
e
g
saline
or
distilled
water
we
did
not
state
that
arginine
solutions
are
irritative
or
that
arginine
treatment
is
dangerous
the
n
acetylcysteine
solution
which
was
successfully
used
before
the
treatment
of
our
patients
was
buffered
with
sodium
hydroxide
to
a
ph
of
the
quantity
of
sodium
which
was
administered
during
each
inhalation
amounts
to
only
mval
of
sodium
so
that
an
injurious
pharmacological
effect
can
be
excluded
both
drugs
were
well
tolerated
and
had
no
deleterious
effects
