and
the
humoral

response
the
occurrence

of
cystic

patients
and
the
occurrence
of
precipitins
against
ps

in

from

have
been
investigated
during
one
year
by
means
of
monthly
bacteriological
examinations
of
tracheal
secretions
and
by
means
of
crossed
immunoelectrophoresis
of
a
polyvalent
ps

antigen
against

from
the

the
one
year
period
prevalence
rate
of
patients
harbouring

was
per
cent
in

patients
and
in
intermittently
colonized
patients
non
mucoid
strains
were
predominating
whereas
mucoid
strains
were
predominating
in
chronically
colonized
patients
the
occurrence
of
mucoid
strains
especially
in
chronically
colonized
patients
was
associated
with
a
significantly
higher
number
of
precipitins
against
ps
aeruginosa
than
the
occurrence
of
non
mucoid
strains
males
chronically
colonized
with
mucoid
strains
presented
a
significantly
higher
number
of
precipitins
than
females
chronically
colonized
with
mucoid
strains
and
the
number
of
precipitins
was
correlated
with
the
duration
of
the
chronic
colonization
with
ps
aeruginosa
in
males
in
contrast
to
females
the
results
are
in
accordance
with
the
hypothesis
that
mucoid
substance
could
be
a
virulence
factor
because
it
might
inhibit
the
opsonizing
effect
of
the
precipitins
on
the
mucoid
cells
and
the
complement
dependent
lysis
of
the
cells
hereby
favouring
mucoid
strains
at
the
expense

nonmucoid
