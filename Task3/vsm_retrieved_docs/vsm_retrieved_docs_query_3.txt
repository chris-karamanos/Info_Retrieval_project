selective
inhibition
of
phagocytic
activity
of
rabbit
alveolar
macrophages
by
cystic
fibrosis
serum
as
far
as
rabbit
alveolar
macrophages
are
concerned
the
concentration
of
homozygous
cf
serum
used
in
our
experiments
was
even
greater
than
the
fourfold
concentration
which
biggar
and
associates
state
was
required
for
normal
phagocytosis
increasing
dilutions
of
homozygous
cf
sera
with
either
hanks
balanced
salt
solution
or
normal
human
serum
thus
decreasing
its
concentration
increased
the
capacity
of
the
rabbit
alveolar
macrophages
to
phagocytize
and
kill
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
increasing
concentrations
had
just
the
opposite
effect
suspension
of
rabbit
alveolar
macrophages
in
human
serum
reduced
their
phagocytic
activity
but
activity
was
reduced
more
by
human
cf
serum
than
by
human
normal
serum
this
is
not
unexpected
because
high
human
serum
concentrations
are
likely
to
be
toxic
to
rabbit
alveolar
macrophages
because
the
inhibition
of
phagocytosis
was
absent
when
homozygous
cf
serum
more
than
hours
old
or
previously
heated
or
frozen
was
used
and
because
of
our
observations
that
dilution
increased
macrophage
phagocytic
ability
we
feel
our
data
demonstrate
the
presence
of
a
labile
inhibitor
rather
than
a
deficiency
since
it
is
well
known
that
cf
patients
have
normal
or
elevated
concentrations
of
immunoglobulins
including
iga
in
their
sera
and
pulmonary
secretions
and
respond
to
infection
and
iga
has
not
been
shown
to
be
essential
for
alveolar
macrophage
phagocytosis
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
we
cannot
agree
that
this
inhibition
is
due
to
an
iga
deficiency
we
also
note
that
some
of
the
sera
used
in
the
experiments
of
biggar
and
associates
were
stored
at
degrees
c
perhaps
this
may
account
for
the
difference
in
results

inhibitory
effect
of
cystic
fibrosis
serum
on
pseudomonas
phagocytosis
by
rabbit
and
human
alveolar
macrophages
this
report
presents
experimental
observations
indicating
the
presence
of
an
inhibitory
activity
in
cystic
fibrosis
cf
serum
which
impairs
phagocytosis
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
by
rabbit
as
well
as
human
alveolar
macrophages
of
the
patient
serum
samples
studied
consistently
showed
greater
than
or
equal
to
inhibition
showed
no
inhibition
and
were
in
the
range
of
inhibition
of
pseudomonas
phagocytosis
in
parallel
studies
the
phagocytosis
of
s
aureus
and
s
marcescens
was
found
not
to
be
inhibited
by
cf
serum
mixing
of
cf
serum
with
normal
serum
could
not
overcome
the
inhibitory
effect
indicating
the
presence
of
an
inhibitory
factor
rather
than
the
lack
of
a
necessary
component
the
inhibitory
activity
is
not
lost
upon
exposure
of
serum
to
glass
upon
freezing
the
serum
once
or
upon
heating
at
degrees
c
for
minutes

indicated
that
these

were
probably
not
derived
from
these
cell
types
although
the
above
three
enzymes
were
present
in

of
all
patients
with
these
three
diseases
large

palmitoyl
lysolecithin
free

dipalmitoyl
lecithin
were
found
only
in
patients
having
alveolar
proteinosis
and
asthma
the
amount
of
free
fatty
acids
in
these
secretions
was
sufficient
to
inhibit
both
the
lysolecithinase
and
the
lysolecithin
lysolecithin
acyltransferase
but
not
the
phospholipase
a
these
findings
suggest
that
the
large
amount
of
dipalmitoyl
lecithin
free
fatty
acids
and
lysolecithin
found
in
these
secretions
results
from
extracellular
remodelling
by
these
enzymes
because
the
phospholipase

was
present
in
large
amounts
it
was
possible
after
delipidation
to
purify
it

it

that
the

represent
the

it

that
the

the

the
