growth
intelligence
and
school
performance
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
who
have
had
an
episode
of
malnutrition
during
infancy
in
this
study
we
have
compared
two
groups
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
one
group
of
cf
children
had
severe
malnutrition
in
the
first
year
of
life
whereas
the
second
group
of
cf
children
had
not
been
malnourished
the
catch
up
growth
experienced
by
both
the
control
and
malnourished
groups
was
impressive
and
was
generally
complete
in
terms
of
height
and
weight
for
age
this
finding
is
consistent
with
other
reports
regarding
catch
up
growth
following
malnutrition
associated
with
celiac
disease
anorexia
nervosa
renal
acidosis
cushing
syndrome
and
hypothyroidism
though
the
malnourished
group
tended
to
have
lower
iq
and
school
performance
scores
the
differences
were
not
statistically
significant
except
for
backward
digit
span
that
difference
may
indicate
an
organic
impairment
due
to
malnutrition
or
to
any
of
several
other
factors
our
data
fail
to
demonstrate
any
permanent
or
devastating
effect
of
early
malnutrition
during
a
very
rapid
growth
phase
on
the
subsequent
growth
iq
and
school
performance
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
studied
at
age
to
years

application
of
the
cilia
dyskinesis
test
in
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
an
adolescent
in
certain
cases
of
obscure
chronic
lung
disease
the
possibility
of
a
genetic
disorder
such
as
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
should
be
considered
when
the
genetic
defect
fails
to
cause
pancreatic
involvement
the
partial
expression
of
cystic
fibrosis
is
encountered
elevation
of
sweat
electrolyte
levels
is
not
sufficient
to
confirm
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
adults
since
normal
levels
vary
widely
in
both
adolescents
and
adults
other
tests
should
therefore
be
utilized
the
cilia
dyskinesis
test
is
positive
in
both
homozygous
and
heterozygous
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
utilization
of
this
technique
in
a
family
study
confirmed
the
diagnosis
of
partial
expression
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
an
adolescent

negative
sweat
tests
and
cystic

two
brothers
are
described
with
chronic
suppurative
pulmonary
disease
one
has
classical
cystic
fibrosis
with
complete
pancreatic
involvement
and
abnormal
sweat

the
other
had
incomplete
pancreatic

with
repeatedly

the

of
a
negative

test
in
patients
with

immunoperoxidase
demonstration
of

sera
from
juvenile
diabetic
and
nondiabetic
controls
were
tested
using
the
immunoperoxidase
method
for
the
presence
of
islet

immunoglobulins
all
diabetic
sera
tested
contained
an
islet
binding
protein
and
on
the
average
the
sera
were
more
positive
than
age
matched
controls
normal
adult
sera
are
undifferentiated
from
juvenile
diabetic
sera
most
sera
from
children
less
than
two
years
of
age
did
not
bind
to
islet
tissue
and
sera
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
had
a
markedly
diminished
ability
to
bind
to
islet
tissue
the
binding
protein
appears
to
be
an

inflammatory
reaction
and
airway
damage
in
cystic
fibrosis
in
cystic
fibrosis
there
is
chronic
infection
and
inflammatory
reaction
in
the
airways
accompanied
by
destruction
and
shedding
of
airway
epithelium
leukocytes
migrate
into
the
airways
and
some
disintegrate
liberating
deoxyribonucleoprotein
that
is
incorporated
into
the
gel
structure
of
the
bronchial
mucus
we
compared
the
status
of
these
processes
in
cystic
fibrosis
with
that
in
chronic
bronchitis
and
bronchiectasis
by
examining
the
sputum
raised
from
the
lower
airways
measurements
also
were
made
on
sputum
induced
in
normal
subjects
the
results
indicate
that
migration
of
leukocytes
into
the
airways
and
shedding
of
damaged
airway
epithelium
were
minimal
in
the
normal
subjects
they
were
significant
in
the
patients
with
chronic
bronchitis
higher
in
those
with
bronchiectasis
and
still
higher
in
those
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
large
increases
found
in
the
total
content
of
dna
and
solids
in
the
cystic
fibrosis
sputum
were
due
to
increases
in
the
insoluble
fraction
containing
the
whole
leukocytes
and
particulate
debris
that
remained
when
the
sputum
mucus
gel
was
solubilized
with
mercaptoethanol
despite
the
large
increases
in
the
total
content
of
dna
and
solids
the
contents
of
mucus
gel
components
and
of
deoxyribonucleoprotein
from
disintegrated
leukocytes
actually
present
in
the
mucus
gel
structure
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
sputum
were
not
significantly
higher
than
in
the
sputum
from
the
patients
with
chronic
bronchitis
or
brochiectasis
