the
precipitins
and
hypersensitivity
reactions
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
large
number
and
wide
variety
of
precipitins
detected
in
the
sputum
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
suggest
that
the
precipitins
may
be
nonprotective
and
even
harmful
to
the
patients
these
sputum
precipitins
were
directed
principally
against
food
fungi
bacteria
and
human
body
tissue
on
the
other
hand
precipitins
to
staphylococcus
alpha
hemolysin
was
the
main
type
of
immunoprecipitin
detected
in
cf
serum
and
was
found
in
of
the
serum
specimens
examined
it
seems
likely
that
the
precipitins
in
patients
with
cf
may
be
involved
in
the
formation
of
immune
complexes
which
in
conjunction
with
complement
may
be
responsible
for
the
respiratory
and
gastrointestinal
lesions
that
are
common
in
patients
with
cf
the
immune
complexes
may
be
the
result
of
excess
food
and
bacterial
antigens
escaping
across
the
gut
and
lungs
as
a
result
of
some
abnormality
of
the
siga
system
over
of
the
sputum
specimens
tested
gave
positive
precipitins
in
agar
gel
against
human
seminal
fluid
and
colostrum
suggesting
that
some
of
the
antibodies
formed
in
cf
patients
could
be
directed
against
host
tissue
and
may
account
for
an
autoimmune
type
reaction
in
cf
crossreaction
between
the
high
titer
antibody
to
staphylococcus
and
basement
membrane
of
lungs
and
pancreas
with
complement
activation
may
occur
in
cf
and
required
further
study
the
high
number
of
b
cells
as
detected
by
antibody
coated
complement
activated
sheep
erythrocytes
and
eac
rosettes
may
be
partly
responsible
for
the

impairment
of
mucociliary
transport
in
cystic

over
the
past
few
years
studies
from
various
laboratories
have
suggested
the

the
possible

role
of
ciliary
dysfunction
in
the

the
disease
is
of
particular
clinical
interest
since
an

been
previously
demonstrated

pulmonary
complications
are
the
hallmark
of
cf

clearance

of

stable
cf
subjects
was
relatively
well
maintained
this
suggested
to
us
that
a
mucociliary
transport
abnormality
might
be
present
intermittently
in
order
to
explore
this
further
we
designed
nasal
mucociliary
clearance
studies
to
determine
whether
cf
serum
might
exhibit
mct
inhibition
in
vivo
from
these
studies
we
concluded
that
there
was
a
substance
s
in
cf
serum
which
had
the
capacity
to
slow
mct
whether
this
effect
is
on
the
cilia
themselves
or
via
overproduction
of

abnormal

cystic

the

or

in
an
outpatient
setting
of
the
chronic

alternative
complement
pathway
activity
in
cystic
fibrosis
letter
the
possibility
has
been
raised
that
complement
plays
a
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
this
impairment
would
be
consistent
with
the
thesis
that
the
alternative
pathway
had
been
activated
in
vivo
and
therefore
depleted
the
purpose
of
this
work
is
to
explore
further
the
function
of
the
alternative
pathway
in
cystic
fibrosis
examination
of
the
data
using
student
s
t
test
and
analysis
of
variance
showed
no
significant
difference
in
the
mean
hemolytic
activity
of
sera
of
cf
patients
as
compared
to
the
control
group
the
data
presented
do
not
support
the
work
of
polley
and
bearn
who
demonstrated
an
abnormality
in
cf
patients
using
conversion
of
c
by
inulin
as
assay
the
reason
for
this
discrepancy
is
not
clear
our
results
do
not
preclude
in
vivo
activation
of
the
alternative
pathway
since
a
compensatory
increase
in
synthesis
of
components
could
offset
component
consumption
since
the
net
result
is
a
completely
normal
level
of
activity
however
it
does
not
seem
likely
that
significant
consumption
has
occurred
