cystic
fibrosis
and
hypertrophic
osteoarthropathy
in
children
report
of
three
cases
three
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
noted
to
have
swelling
of
knee
and
ankle
joints
during
exacerbation
of
their
lung
disease
synovial
fluid
was
analyzed
in
one
patient
and
the
synovium
underwent
biopsy
in
another
these
studies
excluded
other
causes
of
arthritis
but
did
not
contribute
any
new
information
on
the
nature
of
secondary
hypertrophic
osteoarthropathy
radiological
examination
of
long
bones
confirmed
the
diagnosis
of
hypertrophic
osteoarthropathy
in
all
three
patients
since
many
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
survive
longer
more
instances
of
hypertrophic
osteoarthropathy
are
expected
in
the
future

hypertrophic
osteoarthropathy
in
adults
with
cystic
fibrosis
three
adult
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
presented
with
arthralgia
and
investigation
for
the
usual
causes
of
arthritis
proved
negative
radiographs
of
long
bones
revealed
periostitis
and
new
bone
fromation
characteristic
of
hypertrophic
osteoarthropathy
symptomatic
improvement
occurred
after
analgesic
and
anti
inflammatory
therapy
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
bone
or
joint
pain
the
diagnosis
of
hypertrophic
osteoarthropathy
should
be
considered
and
long
bone
radiographs
obtained

possible
hazard
of
timed
release
aspirin
in
a
patient
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
an
episode
of
severe
small
intestinal
hemorrhage
occurred
in
a
cystic
fibrosis
patient
having
pancreatic
insufficiency
and
receiving
timed
release
aspirin
therapy
for
disabling
hypertrophic
pulmonary
osteoarthropathy
the
increased
acidity
of
small
intestinal
contents
due
to
decreased
bicarbonate
secretion
observed
in
patients
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
may
alter
the
luminal
environment
and
result
in
mucosal
erosions
and
or
ulcerations
in
association
with
the
presence
of
aspirin
thus
physicians
should
be
aware
of
the
possibility
that
timed
release
aspirin
causes
small
intestinal
hemorrhage
in
such
patients

recent
advances
in
cystic
fibrosis
research
cystic
fibrosis
at
one
time
was
considered
to
be
a
lethal
condition
with
death
occurring
at
birth
or
within
the
first
year
of
life
with
the
advent
of
antibiotic
therapy
pancreatic
enzyme
replacement
extensive
physical
therapy
and
generally
improved
medical
treatment
many
patients
now
survive
to
adulthood
clinical
manifestations
in
cf
vary
from
patient
to
patient
and
may
include
pulmonary
disease
malnutrition
pancreatic
insufficiency
and
defective
ion
transport
the
most
reliable
laboratory
method
for
diagnosis
of
cf
is
testing
for
elevated
sweat
electrolyte
levels
estimates
of
the
incidence
of
cf
vary
from
in
to
in
among
white
populations
of
mid
european
heritage
the
disease
is
rare
in
black
populations
and
almost
non
existent
in
orientals
since
there
has
been
an
intensive
search
for
a
circulating
factor
or
factors
which
may
be
directly
or
indirectly
responsible
for
the
malfunctions
manifest
in
this
disease
sweat
factors
serum
factors
metachromasia
bioassay
variations
and
properties
of
the
ciliary
inhibitor
are
discussed
several
groups
working
in
cf
research
have
centered
their
attention
on
the
serum
complement
system
agglutination
and
mucus
factors
transport
studies
enzyme
studies
and
prenatal
diagnosis
are
also
examined

sweat
testing
for
cystic
fibrosis
letter
bray
et
al
conclude
that
the
mass
screening
of
newborn
babies
with
chloride
ion
selective
electrodes
is
a
feasible
method
for
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
they
also
suggest
that
this
procedure
might
be
used
in
conjunction
with
meconium
analysis
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
false
positive
results
in
we
reported
the
details
of
a
child
with
proved
cystic
fibrosis
in
whom
raised
sweat
sodium
but
normal
sweat
chloride
levels
were
obtained
during
treatment
with
cloxacillin
attention
was
drawn
to
the
implication
of
the
finding
with
regard
to
screening
procedures
and
the
suggestion
was
made
that
in
at
least
some
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
cloxacillin
radical
might
replace
the
chloride
ion
in
the
sweat
when
mass
screening
for
cystic
fibrosis
is
to
be
undertaken
using
methods
based
on
the
estimation
of
sweat
chloride
levels
it
is
therefore
prudent
to
inquire
whether
the
infant
is
receiving
medication
from
any
source
and
if
so
to
interpret
the
results
with
caution
these
are
instances
of
false
negative
sweat
chloride
readings
but
there
is
no
evidence
yet
from
our
tests
of
any
negative
cystic
fibrosis
sweat
chloride
the
statistical
chance
of
this
is
in
any
case
small
these
several
cases
suggest
a
need
for
a
systematic
investigation
of
the
effect
of
medication
on
sweat
ion
levels
in
general
as
well
as
in
cystic
fibrosis
cases
