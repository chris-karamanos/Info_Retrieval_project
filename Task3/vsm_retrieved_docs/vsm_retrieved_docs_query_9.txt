progress
in
screening
for
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
the
inborn
errors
of
matabolism
are
a
series
of
individually
rare
biochemical
anomalies
some
of
which
cause
serious
clinical
manifestations
they
are
of
great
interest
to
biochemists
and
geneticists
as
well
as
to
paediatricians
and
internist
for
whom
they
often
present
special
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
problems
the
study
of
the
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
also
has
implications
in
the
fields
of
epidemiology
and
social
medicine
the
number
of
known
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
has
increased
rapidly
in
recent
years
and
others
as
yet
unidentified
presumably
await
recognition
only
a
few
of
these
conditions
can
be
treated
now
but
the
realisation
that
early
diagnosis
is
essential
in
order
to
achieve
good
results
has
stimulated
interest
in
the
possibility
of
examining
either
whole
populations
or
selected
predisposed
groups
of
individuals
for
biochemical
differences
which
characterise
particular
inherited
metabolic
diseases
this
article
reviews
some
recent
developments
with
particular
reference
to
the
indications
for
such
screening
programmes
and
progress
in
the
identification
of
previously
unknown
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
in
otherwise
homogeneous
population
groups
the
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
are
due
to
single
gene
mutations
recognition
of
the
asymptomatic
individuals
who
are
heterozygous
for
the
abnormal
gene
causing
the
disease
may
be
important
clinically
and
the
identification
has
to
be
considered
as
one
aspect
of
metabolic
screening
for
the
inborn
errors
of
metabolism

epidemiology
of
cystic
fibrosis
a
review
three
main
reasons
have
been
advanced
for
the
degree
of
ignorance
and
confusion
surrounding
epidemiologic
measures
of
the
incidence
and
prevalence
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
relatively
recent
recognition
of
cf
as
a
specific
disease
entity
wide
range
of
clinical
manifestations
presentation
as
a
multisystem
disease
and
great
natural
variation
in
the
severity
of
involvement
of
various
organs
past
difficulty
in
establishing
a
diagnosis
based
on
sound
laboratory
evidence
this
being
largely
due
to
the
lack
of
a
screening
test
that
had
gained
wide
acceptance
among
diagnosticians
and
inaccuracies
in
the
performance
and
interpretation
of
the
sweat
test
in
addition
to
these
factors
there
are
a
number
of
methodological
deficiencies
and
questionable
assumptions
in
several
of
the
papers
that
have
here
been
reviewed
it
may
be
noteworthy
that
the
two
sets
of
authors
whose
research
design
most
closely
matched
being
aimed
at
providing
multiple
ascertainment
of
cases
and
cross
checks
of
validity
have
arrived
at
nearly
the
same
estimated
incidence
of
this
particular
disorder
and
respectively
the
issue
of
selection
and
diagnostic
criteria
is
one
that
has
important
implications
for
epidemiologic
studies
of
cystic
fibrosis
particularly
in
a
disease
like
cf
where
the
spectrum
of
clinical
manifestations
and
severity
of
involvement
is
so
broad
estimates
of
incidence
will
vary
according
to
the
criteria
by
which
cases
are
ascertained
and
included
a
greater
degree
of
uniformity
in
standards
than
has
been
employed
in
previous
studies
is
necessary
before
comparisons
can
meaningfully
be
made
there
are
good
grounds
for
regarding
most
estimates
of
cf
incidence
to
be
minimum
confirmed
figures
and
this
is
particularly
so
where
the
research
design
ensures
that
multiple
ascertainments
of
the
same
case
will
be
identifiable
higher
estimates
are
made
where
several
sources
of
error
respondent
bias
generalization
of
hospital
data
to
the
wider
population
multiple
ascertainments
of
the
same
patient
are
not
recognised
