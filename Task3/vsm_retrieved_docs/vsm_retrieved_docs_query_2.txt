comparison
of
two
mucolytic
drugs
for
inhalation
treatment
acetylcysteine
and
arginine
hydrochloride
clinical
bronchoscopic
spirographic
scintigraphic
and
chemical
analyses
were
done
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
assess
the
mucolytic
effects
of
acetylcysteine
inhalations
versus
l
arginine
hydrochloride
aerosols
the
latter
drug
is
less
active
than
acetylcysteine
and
should
not
be
used
to
treat
children
with
cystic
fibrosis

mists
and
aerosols
new
studies
new
thoughts
the
recent
data
suggest
that
we
can
no
longer
use
mist
tents
or
intermittent
aerosol
therapy
for
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
the
abandon
previously
employed
we
cannot
accept
such
therapy
as
having
been
proved
to
be
effective
we
formerly
believed
aerosols
and
mists
could
do
little
harm
we
now
know
they
can
be
harmful
if
such
treatment
is
to
be
used
the
patient
should
be
closely
monitored
clinically
and
with
sensitive
pulmonary
function
tests
such
as
maximum
expiratory
flow
volume
curves
it
is
obvious
that
we
have
much
more
to
learn
confirm
or
disprove
with
respect
to
the
rationale
for
and
benefits
of
mist
and
aerosol
therapy

use
of
water
vapor
in
the
treatment
of
lower
respiratory
disease
use
of
bland
aerosols
particularly
mist
tents
in
the
treatment
of
lower
respiratory
disease
was
reviewed
and
no
convincing
evidence
of
efficacy
was
found
this
is
not
surprising
because
there
is
evidence
that
mist
tents
deposit
little
water
in
the
lower
respiratory
tract
mist
tents
may
be
detrimental
in
some
cases
because
of
bacterial
contamination
and
because
they
can
cause
bronchospasm

pulmonary
deposition
of
aerosols
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
efficiency
of
delivery
of
an
aerosol
to
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
aged
months
to
years
was
investigated
with
the
use
a
standard
ultrasonic
nebulizer
the
study
was
designed
to
simulate
clinical
conditions
as
closely
as
possible
retention
of
the
aerosol
was
monitored
with
a
scintillation
camera
interfaced
to
a
small
digital
computer
the
children
also
had
ventilation
studies
with
xenon
which
allowed
comparison
of
the
distribution
of
aerosol
with
regional
ventilation
the
aerosol
was
visualized
within
the
lungs
of
all
patients
between
and
per
cent
of
the
initial
activity
was
deposited
in
the
lungs
representing
an
average
of
ml
per
therapy
session
or
ml
per
kilogram
of
body
weight
there
was
a
positive
correlation
r
p
between
increasing
age
and
greater
pulmonary
deposition
of
the
aerosol
there
was
decreased
aerosol
entry
to
regions
which
were
poorly
ventilated
the
efficiency
of
aerosol
deposition
is
variable
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
depending
primarily
on
the
age
of
the
patient
whereas
its
distribution
within
their
lungs
is
related
to
regional
variations
in
the
severity
of
the
pulmonary
disease

physiotherapy
for
adolescents
and
adults
with
cystic
fibrosis
physiotherapy
for
adolescents
and
adults
with
cystic
fibrosis
is
continued
along
the
same
lines
as
for
younger
patients
but
certain
modifications
may
be
necessary
to
fit
in
with
their
changing
needs
when
patients
are
transferred
from
the
care
of
the
paediatrician
to
the
thoracic
physician
it
may
be
helpful
for
them
to
be
admitted
to
hospital
for
reassessment
during
this
admission
the
opportunity
can
be
taken
to
review
the
daily
physiotherapy
regimen
with
the
patients
and
their
parents
