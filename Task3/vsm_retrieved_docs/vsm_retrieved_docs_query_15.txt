tropomyosin
antibody
the
specific
localization
of
tropomyosin
in

cells
an
antibody
against

chicken
skeletal
muscle
tropomyosin
is
used
in
indirect
immunofluorescence
to
visualize
the
localization
of
tropomyosin
in
a
variety
of
nonmuscle
cells
the
antibody
produces
a
fluorescent
pattern
which
is
very
similar
to
that
obtained
with
an
actin
specific
antibody
this
pattern
is
composed
of
fluorescent
fibers
which
are
shown
to
be
coincident
with
the
fibers
seen
with
phase
contrast
optics
high
resolution
epifluorescent
microscopy
reveals
that
fibers
stained
with
the
actin
antibody
show
a
continuous
fluorescence
while
fibers
reacted
with
the
tropomyosin
antibody
show
a
periodic
fluorescence
measurements
indicate
that
the
lengths
of
the
fluorescent
segments
are
variable
with
an
average
of
mum
while
the
spacing
between
segments
is
approximately
mum

cystic

and

fibrosis
letter
we
were
interested
in
the
case
reported
by
mukherji
et
al
which
suggested
that
cystic
fibrosis
might
be
an
acid
mucopolysaccharidosis
we
have
seen
a
similar
child
aged
years
he
was
admitted
to
hospital
with
pneumonia
in
spite
of
conventional
treatment
with
cloxacillin
and
colistin
he
collapsed
and
died
hours
after
admission
the
heart
was
not
enlarged
but
the
myocardium
showed
a
grossly
abnormal
appearance
with
variations
in
thickness
and
extensive
areas
of
firm
pale
tissue
histology
of
the
heart
muscle
showed
very
dramatic
changes
with
severe
replacement
fibrosis
distributed
patchily
through
the
myocardium
this
similar
mixture
of
neutral
and
acid
mucopolysaccharides
was
shown
in
both
the
pancreas
and
the
salivary
glands
there
have
now
been
a
number
of
reports
of
myocardial
fibrosis
complicating
cystic
fibrosis
the
case
reported
by
mukherji
et
al
and
this
case
are
the
first
in
which
mucopolysaccharide
deposits
have
been
found
in
the
myocardium
the
mixture
of
neutral
and
acid
mucopolysaccharides
in
our
case
does
not
support
the
hypothesis
that
cystic
fibrosis
is
simply
a
genetic
acid
mucopolysaccharidosis

ventilatory

training
in
normal
subjects
and
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
ventilatory
muscles
can
become
fatigued
and
this
can
contribute
to
respiratory
failure
patients
with
chronic
obstructive
lung
disease
may
benefit
from
improving
their
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
to
improve
resistance
to
fatigue
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
was
measured
in
normal
subjects
and
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
by
finding
the
highest
level
of
normocapnic
hyperpnea
that
could
be
sustained
for
min
subjects
with
cystic
fibrosis
had
per
cent
higher
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
than
normal
subjects
reflecting
the
chronic
training
stress
of
breathing
against
increased
respiratory
loads
four
normal
subjects
and
subjects
with
cystic

participated
in
a
specific
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
training
program
consisting
of
min
per
day
of
maximal
normocapnic
hyperpnea
days
per
week
for
weeks
the
cystic
fibrosis
patients
who
trained
improved
their
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
by
per
cent
whereas
the
normal
subjects
who
trained
showed
a
per
cent
increase
in
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
seven
subjects
with
cystic

participated
in
a
week
physical
activity
training
program
consisting
of
at
least
hours
per
day
of
intensive
swimming
and
canoeing
at
summer
camp
they
increased
their
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
by
per
cent
there
were
no
other
pulmonary
function
changes
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
can
be
readily
improved

by
