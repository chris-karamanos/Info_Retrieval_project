of

predominating

in

there

a

this

letter
my
colleagues
and
i
reviewed
the
diagnosis

in
cases
of

severe

who
were
admitted
to

boston
between
and
there
was
a
mortality
overall
six
of
the
infants
were
treated
with
assisted
ventilation
of
whom
only
one
survived
our
subsequent
experience
with

has
shown
no

in
the

of
these

a
new
therapeutic
challenge
for
the
primary
care
physician
in
this
article
we
will
examine
the
reasons
for
the
prolonged
survival
of
individuals
with
cystic
fibrosis
as
well
as
discuss
the
pathogenesis
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
this
multisystemic
disease
the
reasons
for
the
improved
prognosis
in
cf
are
multiple
improved
antibiotic
therapy
early
diagnosis
specialized
care
centers
and
aggressive
treatment
regimens
this
presents
the
primary
care
physician
with
a
new
and
challenging
patient
population
requiring
the
coordinated
effort
of
the
health
care
team
including
specialists
nurses
therapists
etc
to
achieve
effective
therapy
for
this
truly
multisystemic
disease

the

for
five
year
survival
statistical
discriminant
analysis
is
applied
to
concomitant
variables
obtained
during
the
first
year
of
study
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
a
discriminant
function
based
on
six
variables
is
developed
which
can
be
used
as
a
predictive
index
this
index
estimates
the
probability
of
year
survival
for
an
individual
patient
and
can
also
be
used
to
classify
patients
into
one
of
two
groups
will
live
for
years
or
will
die
within
years
speculation
a
classification
rule
for
cystic
fibrosis
is
presented
which
correctly
assigns
of
the
year
survivors
and
of
those
who
expire
such
a
classification
scheme
is
useful
for
clinical
and
research
purposes

cystic
fibrosis
clinical
aspects
cystic
fibrosis
is
a
fatal
inherited
disease
involving
many
different
organs
at
one
time
most
affected
children
died
within
a
few
years
of
birth
but
modern
management
has
led
to
a
marked
improvement
in
prognosis
and
of
course
to
an
increase
in
the
number
of
affected
older
children
and
young
adults
cystic
fibrosis
is
therefore
no
longer
a
disease
encountered
only
in
paediatric
units
but
with
increasing
survival
into
teens
and
twenties
affected
patients
are
now
appearing
in
adult
units
the
aetiology
and
pathology
the
clinical
picture
diagnosis
treatment
and
prognosis
are
discussed
