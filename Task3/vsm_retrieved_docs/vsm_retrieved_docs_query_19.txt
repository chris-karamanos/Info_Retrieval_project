the
purpose
here
was
to
test
for
a
generalized
abnormal
sensitivity
of
the
external
chemoreceptive
systems
using
a
standardized
method
that
separates
sensory
activity
from
biasing
factors
known
to
affect
measurement
of
sensitivity
the

distributions
of

given
normal

and
control
patients
did
not
differ
statistically
and
they
were
combined
into
a
single
control
group
for
analyses
the
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
did
not
differ
as
a
group
from
the
normal
subjects
in
salt
sensitivity
there
were
however
two
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
with
taste
sensitivities
well
below
those
observed
among
the
normal
children
no
age
or
sex
differences
in
sensitivity
were
observed
the
taste
sensitivity
of
the
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
did
not
correlate
with
the
shwachman
and
kulczycki
rating
of
the
severity
of
their
disease
of
the
seven
children
who
had
determinations
of
sweat
electrolytes
at
the
time
of
taste
testing
three
failed
to
excrete
sufficient
amounts
for
measurements
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
as
a
group
were
not
found
to
have
more
sensitive
taste
acuity
than
normal
this
corroborates
the
findings
of
wotman
and
associates
and
strongly
suggests
that
a
general
abnormality
of
the
taste
system
is
not
routinely
symptomatic
of
cystic
fibrosis
henkin
and
powell
hypothesized
that
extremely
acute
taste
is
related
to
elevations
in
the
concentration
of
electrolytes
in
sweat
this
seems
unlikely
since
the
patients
given
sweat
tests
in
the
present
study
all
had
the
high
levels
of
sodium
and
chloride
characteristic
of
cystic
fibrosis
yet
all
had
taste
sensitivities
in
the
normal
range
wotman
and
associates
suggested
that
perhaps
the
severity
of
the
disease
accounts
for
the
appearance
of
hypersensitivity
in
the
chemoreceptive
systems
the
clinical
ratings
of
the
severity
of
the
disease
did
not
correlate
with
taste
sensitivity

olfactory
and
taste
sensitivity
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
psychophysical
experiments
measured
both
olfactory
sensitivity
to
butanol
and
sodium
chloride
and
taste
sensitivity
to
sodium
chloride
in
normal
children
and
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
sensitivity
of
the
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
fell
within
the
normal
range
these
results
stand
in
contrast
to
those
of
henkin
and
powell
who
found
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
be
hypersensitive
to
both
olfactory
and
taste
stimuli
apparent
hypersensitivity
to
taste
stimuli
could
have
resulted
from
the
adapting
effects
of
the
relatively
high
level
of
sodium
in
the
saliva
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
if
the
contaminating
effects
of
saliva
are
removed
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
yield
on
the
average
a
taste
threshold
identical
to
that
of
normal
children
there
appears
to
be
no
simple
explanation
for
why
henkin
and
powell
found
hypersensitivity
to
odorants
the
present
results
indicate
that
in
fact
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
display
a
slight
hyposensitivity
to
odorants

gastrointestinal
and
nutritional
manifestations
of
cystic
fibrosis
pp
the
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
summarize
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
of
the
gastrointestinal
manifestations
and
absorption
and
metabolism
of
nutrients
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
gastrointestinal
manifestations
include
pancreatic
exocrine
insufficiency
pancreatic
calcification
and
stones
diabetes
liver
and
gall
bladder
abnormalities
intestinal
obstruction
and
complications
of
malabsorption
nutritional
aspects
of
cystic
fibrosis
include
growth
retardation
and
body
composition
fat
and
nitrogen
absorption
amino
acid
absorption
medium
chain
triglyceride
absorption
and
deficiency
of
fat
soluble
vitamins
the
critical
questions
for
projection
into
the
future
fall
into
three
categories
intestinal
absorption
gastrointestinal
function
and
experimental
design

complex

metabolism
in
cystic
fibrosis
fibroblasts
there
are
several
reports
of
secretory
and
other
abnormalities
present
in
cultured
fibroblasts
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
we
have
therefore
investigated
aspects
of
complex
saccharide
synthesis
and
secretion
by
such
cells
compared
with
fibroblasts
derived
from
heterozygous
hz
parents
and
from
normal
n
children
the
main
glycosaminoglycans
produced
by
skin
fibroblasts
during
in
vitro
culture
were
hyaluronic
acid
heparan
sulfates
and
dermatan
sulfate
like
materials
using
double
label
experiments
with
d
h
or
c
glucosamine
and
analyzing
the
products
by
ion
exchange
chromatography
it
was
shown
for
five
cf
two
hz
and
four
n
lines
that
these
polysaccharides
were
secreted
into
the
medium
in
approximately
similar
proportions
to
each
other
moreover
experiments
in
which
three
cf
nine
hz
and
three
n
lines
were
grown
in
log
phase
for
up
to
days
in
the
presence
of
s
sulfate
and
h
glucosamine
indicate
that
during
such
a
period
cf
fibroblasts
do
not
secrete
complex
carbohydrates
at
rates
significantly
different
from
n
or
hz
cells
neither
do
such
cells
shown
an
abnormal
intracellular
accumulation
of
complex
carbohydrates
the
latter
observation
was
further
confirmed
by
preparing
whole
cell
autoradiographs
during
growth
of
six
cf
two
hz
and
three
n
lines
in
the
presence
of
d
h
glucosamine
and
subsequently
after
addition
of
unlabeled
medium
